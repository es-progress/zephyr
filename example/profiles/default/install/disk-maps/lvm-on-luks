## LVM on LUKS ##
#################

# In this setup, we create LUKS encrypted physical volumes then use LVM on top of them.

# There are two disks in this system:
#   - main: the main disk where Ubuntu is installed (20 GB)
#   - store: a secondary disk for NTFS media storage and also for Ubuntu (5 GB)
#
# The main disk has the following partitions:
#   - EFI: a small partition for the EFI bootloader
#   - BOOT: a partition for the Linux bootloader
#   - PV_MAIN: physical volume for LVM on the main disk
#
# Secondary disk partitions:
#   - MEDIA: an NTFS partition for media storage (can be used for Windows too)
#   - PV_STORE: physical volume for LVM on the secondary disk
#
# The partitioning scheme is as follows:
[disks]
# disk_name device   [part_prefix]
main        /dev/sda
store       /dev/sdb
[partitions]
# disk_name num  gap  size type  label    crypt filesystem
main          1    0  128M efi   EFI      -     fat32
main          2    0  512M luks  BOOT     luks1 ext4
main          3  32M   18G luks  PV_MAIN  luks2 -

store         1    0    2G win   MEDIA    -     ntfs
store         2 512M    2G luks  PV_STORE luks2 -

# LVM structure
#
# We use one volume group (vg-main) for all logical volumes.
# The volume group is created from the physical volumes on the main and store disks.
#
# The logical volumes are created as follows:
#   - root: the main root filesystem (14 GB)
#   - home: a separate home partition (3 GB)
#   - swap: a swap partition (100% of the remaining space)
[vol-groups]
# vg-name  physical-volumes
vg-main    PV_MAIN,PV_STORE
[volumes]
# vg-name name     size crypt filesystem
vg-main   root      14G -     ext4
vg-main   home       3G -     ext4
vg-main   swap 100%FREE -     swap
